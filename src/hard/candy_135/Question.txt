There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

如果鄰居的 rating 比你高，那他的糖果就會比你多，相同 rating的人糖果數目可以不同。
Ex:
rating: 12311 -> 糖果 12311
rating: 122421 -> 糖果 121321
也就是永遠遵循的 rating 比你高糖果比你多，相等就任意。

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.



Constraints:

    n == ratings.length
    1 <= n <= 2 * 104
    0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104
